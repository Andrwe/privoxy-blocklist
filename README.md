Script converting AdBlock Plus rules into privoxy format.

## How does it work

The script `privoxy-blocklist.sh` downloads AdBlock Plus filter files and generates privoxy compatible filter and action files based on these.
After the generation is done it modifies the privoxy configuration files `/etc/privoxy/config` to import the generated files.

Due to this behaviour the script must run as root user to be able to modify the privoxy configuration file.

## Usage

Either run `privoxy-blocklist.sh` manually with root privileges (e.g., `sudo privoxy-blocklist.sh`) or via root cronjob.

## Tests

Code changes must be tested to ensure that all functionality is working as intended.
For that a pytest based test suite is maintained and runs on every pull request within [Gitlab Actions](https://github.com/Andrwe/privoxy-blocklist/actions).

### Run Local Tests

The test suite is designed to run within a docker container based on the definition of this repository.
It is currently only tested on Ubuntu Linux but should work on every system with a POSIX compliant shell and docker.

#### Docker

For this method you only require docker to be installed and the permission to run docker containers with volume mounts.

To start all tests of the test suite just run:
```
./tests/run.sh
```

To start a single test file you can run:
```
./tests/run.sh tests/test_â€¦.py
```

The whole process simplified by [./tests/run.sh](https://github.com/Andrwe/privoxy-blocklist/blob/master/tests/run.sh) runs the following:

1. build docker image based on [project Dockerfile](https://github.com/Andrwe/privoxy-blocklist/blob/master/Dockerfile)
1. start container based on created image with git repository mounted to `/app` and persistent volume for pytest-cache mounted to `/pytest_cache`

Within the container all pytest magic happens and all scripts matching `test_*.py` within `tests/` are executed.
